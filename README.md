Deposits of natural gas are found not only ashore. There are offshore fields – oil and gas are sometimes found in the depths of the hidden water. <a href="https://www.futureon.com/" rel="nofollow">FutureOn</a> suggests the  know-how platform for optimizing offshore oil engineering. If speaking about the exploration of offshore oil, in general terms, all operations are similar to those that make up the oilfield on land. However, oil production at sea has a number of specific features. 

Drilling is the main element of the exploration and production of oil. At sea it is either a kind of hydraulic structures — stationary bases for drilling rigs or mobile drilling rigs. Prevalent are steel-structured foundations. Initially. they were installed in the sea on metal piles hammered into the bottom at depths of up to 20-30 meters. They are fully assembled and mounted in the sea, and this is possible only in calm weather.

A big-block base is an improved design of such constructions. According to its technical characteristics they are used at depths of 60-90 m. In addition, bases of this type allowed to industrialize construction and installation processes. Large blocks of bases are entirely manufactured in factories and delivered to the construction site at sea.

Here a special crane vessel in a short time mounts the artificial island and sets it on a drilling rig. Piling and large-block production sites are located in the sea, either as separate bases or connected, and in many cases, lined with the shore by trestle crossings. Drilling is performed by single and group wells. Such sea oil fields are most widespread in the United States and Venezuela. The stationary base, mainly large-block structures can be applied at depths of 100 meters but their construction is very expensive.

Currently, for offshore they started using a mobile base. It is a large platform with a drilling rig, which is towed to the desired point where it is installed on the bottom with retractable leg-supports.

Unsupported platforms are constructed and used to operate at depths exceeding 200 metres. One of them for 10 years quite successfully operates at depths of about 200 meters of the French oil company.

More mobile and therefore more effective means of deep sea drilling is ships with rigs on board. They are drilling through the keel, and modern electronic and sonar equipment ensures fixing the vessel at the desired point and re-introducing the drill pipe at the mouth of the subsea well.

Even such a brief consideration of the basic means of developing oil and gas fields in the World ocean shows that the extraction of oil and gas from the seabed is a complex and specific engineering task, which directed major investments. The application of this technology depends on geographical description of the area.
